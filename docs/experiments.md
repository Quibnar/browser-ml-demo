# Experiments

This document tracks exploratory ideas, experiments, and dead ends encountered during development.

## Explored Ideas

- Real-time prediction updates during continuous input
- Visualizing intermediate model states
- Adjustable model parameters via UI controls

## Rejected or Deferred Approaches

- Heavy models requiring long load times
- Server-assisted inference (out of scope)
- Over-optimization at the cost of clarity

## Lessons Learned

- UX clarity matters more than raw model performance
- Browser ML is viable for interaction-scale problems
- Tooling maturity varies widely across platforms

## Open Questions

- Where is the threshold between browser and edge inference?
- How should uncertainty be communicated to users?
- What interaction patterns benefit most from ML augmentation?

These experiments are intentionally documented to make the development process transparent.
