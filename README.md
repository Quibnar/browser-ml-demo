# Browser ML Demo

A browser-based machine learning experiment demonstrating real-time inference and interaction entirely on the client.

## What this is
This project explores how lightweight ML models can run directly in the browser to support interactive, user-facing experiences without server-side inference.

## Demo
- Live demo: (link if available)
- Screenshots: see `/media`

## Why
Modern UX increasingly requires intelligent behavior with low latency, privacy preservation, and minimal infrastructure. This demo investigates what is practical today using browser-native technologies.

## What’s implemented
- Client-side ML inference
- Interactive input → prediction loop
- Lightweight model execution
- Visual feedback loop

## Architecture (high level)
- Frontend: Browser-based UI
- ML Runtime: Client-side inference
- Data Flow: User input → model → UI feedback

## Status
✅ Core demo logic  
✅ Client-side inference  
⚠️ Model optimization (in progress)  
⚠️ Production hardening (out of scope for demo)
